Task completed at ALX Software Engineering program

Task 1. 0-binary_to_uint.c
Function converts binary number to unsigned integer. Protoype -unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b); 

Task 2 1-print_binary.c
void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
Prints binary rep of a number. Use of malloc, arrays, % or/ is prohibited

Task 3 2-get_bit.c
int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
Returns value of a bit at a certain index. 

Task 4 3-set_bit.c
int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
Sets value of bit at a particular index. index is index beginning at 0 of bit to be set. 

Task 5 4-clear_bit.c
int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
index is starting fromm 0 of bit to set

Task 6 5-flip_bits.c
unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
Function returns no. bits needed to flip from a no to another
Not allowed to use % or /

Task 7 100-get_endianness.c
int get_endianness(void);
Function checks endianness, returns 1 if little, 0 if big
